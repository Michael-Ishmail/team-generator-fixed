This is my completed team generator application. The application is used via the terminal, and is started by using the "node script.js" command.

The user will be prompted with several questions regarding employees, once these questions are answered and no more employees are added, the javascript will generate an HTML document with the data that was input. This HTML document is saved in the gen folder and is named output.html.

I ran into an issue where i needed to re-initialize the npm package.json file in order to fix an error i was receiving in the console. However, once i did this and attempted to merge on GitHub, i ran into a merge conflict. I attempted to fix the conflict, but i was unable to get GitHub to merge the feature/script branch to the develop branch. I was not able to figure out how to fix the issue properly, so i decided to create a new repository with the files from the feature/script branch. I have attached both repositories to this file so that my commits are all visible.

Below is the fixed repository with no merge conflicts
